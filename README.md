# Installation

Tara can be installed in 2 simple steps:

1. **Install executable**

If your desired platform isn't seen below, please [open an issue][issues].

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

> The recommended way to install Tara is by way of a package manager.
> If using `cargo install`, some dependencies won't automatically be installed. You'll need to install `sqlite3` previous to running the instructions.
> On Debian and Ubuntu systems the required package is `libsqlite3-dev`, on Arch and related systems it's `sqlite`.
>
> | Distribution | Repository      | Instructions                  |
> | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
> | *Any*        | **[crates.io]** | `cargo install tara --locked` |

</details>

2. **Configure**

Before the bot can be started successfully, it needs to be configured.

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

> The configuration file is located at `/etc/tara.d/tara.toml`.

</details>

The configuration file should look similarly to below:

```toml
direct_message_cooldown = 5 # Optional

[secrets]
# Discord bot token
token = "<DISCORD_TOKEN>"

# API key from currencyapi.com.
currencyApiKey = "<CURRENCYAPI.COM>" # Optional
```

Present in all the configuration files are the following keys:

- *`direct_message_cooldown`* - This optional key is to set the minimum duration, in seconds, to allow between running commands in a direct message. The default is `3`.

- *`secrets.token`* - The discord token can be aquired according to *[Building your first Discord app][discord-getting-started]*.

- *`secrets.currencyApiKey`* - The `currencyApiKey` is an optional key to enable the currency conversion feature. This can be aquired from [currencyapi.com][currencyapi]. The feature will, at most, refresh every six hours. This means the feature will never need a paid API key.
